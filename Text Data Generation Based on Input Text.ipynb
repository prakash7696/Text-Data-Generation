      "Line 46: If you need this design to be fabricated, you will need to contact a professional fabrication company in your area. Fabrication companies can provide custom fabrication services such as welding, machining, and other metal fabrication services. They can help you turn your design into a physical product.\n",
      "Line 47: If you are looking for a design to fabricate, you may want to consider looking for a CAD (Computer Aided Design) program to help you create the design you need. CAD programs are often used by professionals to create designs for fabrication, so they will help you create a design that is accurate and precise. Additionally, you can find many tutorials online that can help you learn how to use the software to create your own design.\n",
      "Line 48: I'm sorry, but we cannot provide design services for fabrication. You will need to hire a professional designer to create a design for fabrication.\n",
      "Line 49: If you need help with designing the fabric, you can contact a fabric designer or a textile designer. They can help you create a design that will work best for your project. You can also look for fabric designs online that you can purchase and use for your project.\n",
      "Line 50: Unfortunately, we do not have the resources to provide fabrication services. However, you may be able to find someone who can help you with the fabrication of your design. You could check with local fabrication shops, online fabrication services, or even a local maker space to find someone who can help you.\n"
